            <h3>1.What is DOM and what is the purpose of DOM?</h3>
         <p class="mx-lg-3"> DOM refers to Document Object Model. DOM is the programming interface for a HTML document. <br>
            The purpose of DOM is to interrupt inside the html document that means how to use or change the property
            of the html document by using javascript.In the DOM, all the HTML elements are defined as objects. And it performs all the task from
            inside the javascript.  
         </p>
        </div>

       <div class="mx-lg-5">
        <h3>
            2.How will you select HTML elements using DOM? Name the DOM methods.
        </h3>
        <p class="mx-lg-3">
            I can select HTML elements and get the elements by using unique Id , by class name , by HTML tag name
            and by querySelector or querySelectorAll.
            <br>
            DOM methods are - <br>

            1. getElementById <br>
            2. getElementsByClassName <br>
            3. getElementsByTagName <br>
            4.querySelector <br>
            5.querySelectorAll <br>

                3. What is event bubble?
            </h3>
            <p class="mx-lg-3">
                If there's a event that is ongoing or clicked and there's also events in it's parent node than these
                events are also be performed or clicked. <br>
                If we want to perform only target event not these events that are in the parent node 
                than we should use stopPropagation .
            </p>

            4. What is a callback function and why will you use it? 
        </h3>
        <p class="mx-lg-3">
            The function that is called itself is called callback function.

            <br>
            we use this callback function to reduce the redundancy of the codes. sometimes same type of task can
            be done again and again , in this situation function are very helpful for us..again in the function,
            there also do the same task again and again.than we call the same function inside the function.And this 
            type of function is called callback function.
            <br>
        
             - It reduces the same type of code redundancy.
            <br>
             - It reduces the code length. <br>
             - And it saves our time.
